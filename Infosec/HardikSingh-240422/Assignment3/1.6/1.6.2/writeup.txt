scanned with strings
found some things that suggested an input was being evaluated
ran the program
program actually was checking for input
used IDA Pro to disassemble the code in rev
found the main function
it was essentially validating the input using validate function
went to the validate function to find that it was comparing against a bunch of numbers; by their values they looked to be ascii
decoded them to get flag{HuCf_lAb}
voila
