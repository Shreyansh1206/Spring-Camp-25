analysed the pwn1 file; was a elf binary
ran it
was an I/O type CTF file
used IDA to decompile; found the correct answers to first two questions
noticed that the last input was being compare to the hex value 0DEA110C8h or 0xdea110c8
the last input had to be more than 0x2b long, as the string was being stored at -0x3b and the variable that is being compared is at -0x10
thus the payload was designed as the flag was obtained
flag{g0ttem_b0yz}
voila
