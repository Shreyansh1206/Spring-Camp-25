## Solution
```
                                                              
❯ ./rev
zsh: permission denied: ./rev
                                                                
❯ chmod +x rev
                                                                
❯ ./rev

We see that we need a password to access the file so on opening the file on ghidra
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f79bf68-234f-45ad-a135-9ea77b895640)

We see that is scans for a password and it calls a validate function to validate the password on looking at that function:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c10fa0-7c01-4ef1-b1da-f3eb144096a3)

We see that it checks every character for characters given in the function and if correct, it might execute the file. So, we see the binaries are given for the password as:
```
0x66, 0x6c, 0x61, 0x67, 0x7b, 0x48, 0x75, 0x43, 0x66, 0x5f, 0x6c, 0x41, 0x62, 0x7d
```
Now on joining the characters with a python code:
```
password_bytes = [0x66, 0x6c, 0x61, 0x67, 0x7b, 0x48, 0x75, 0x43, 0x66, 0x5f, 0x6c, 0x41, 0x62, 0x7d]
password = ''.join([chr(byte) for byte in password_bytes])

print(password)
```
```
❯ python3 password.py
flag{HuCf_lAb}
```
```
❯ ./rev
Welcome to the Salty Spitoon™, How tough are ya?
flag{HuCf_lAb}
Right this way...
```
