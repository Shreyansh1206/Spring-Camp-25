This is the final project for the machine learning spring camp, a gesture recogniser and classifier

Static gestures recognised 
- Thumbs Up
- Thumbs Down
- Ok (touch tip of thumb to that of index finger and extend remaining fingers out)
- Stop (palm facing camera extend all fingers out)

Dynamic gestures recognised
- Hello
- No No No (Etend index finger rest all folded and wiggle side ways)
- Wrist Stretch (Extend and contract all fingers with palm facing camera)

  If the main file does not run try with python 3.11 (for mediapipe) and try shifting all files into a single directory (including those in Models and csv_files)
